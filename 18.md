# Virtualization is the Foundation of Cloud Computing: Is it possible to have a successful public cloud without hypervisors, and what would that look like?

## Introduction

Good morning everyone! Today I want to challenge a common assumption. Everyone thinks cloud computing absolutely needs hypervisors, right? Virtual machines, VMware, all that stuff. But here's the surprising truth - we can absolutely have a successful public cloud WITHOUT traditional hypervisors! In fact, it's already happening. Let me show you how.

## Understanding the Traditional Model

Let me first explain what everyone assumes is necessary. In traditional cloud, you have physical servers running a hypervisor. This hypervisor creates virtual machines for different customers. Each VM is isolated, each customer thinks they have their own server. This is how AWS EC2, Azure, Google Compute Engine - all the big players work.

The assumption is that hypervisors are essential for:
- Keeping different customers' data separate (isolation)
- Sharing hardware efficiently between multiple users
- Providing flexibility to scale up and down
- Maintaining security

But what if I told you there are other ways to achieve all of this?

## Alternative One: Containers Instead of VMs

Here's the first alternative - containers! Now, containers work very differently from virtual machines.

**How containers are different:**
With VMs, each virtual machine has its own full operating system. That's heavy - each VM might be gigabytes in size and takes minutes to start.

With containers, they all share the same OS kernel. They're just isolated processes. A container might be only megabytes in size and starts in seconds. No hypervisor needed!

**Real-world success: Google Cloud Run**
Google Cloud Run is a perfect example. You give them your application in a container, and they run it directly - no VMs involved. It auto-scales, it's fast, it's simple. And it's a successful commercial service serving thousands of customers!

**The benefits are clear:**
- Containers start in milliseconds, not minutes
- You can pack hundreds of containers on one server instead of just dozens of VMs
- Lower overhead means better performance
- Simpler architecture means easier management

**But there's a catch:**
Since containers share the same kernel, there's less isolation. If someone breaks out of a container, they could potentially access the host system. Security is a concern. Also, all containers must use the same OS - you can't run Windows and Linux containers on the same host easily.

**Success story: Heroku**
Heroku is basically a container-based cloud platform that's been around since 2007 - before Docker was even popular! They run millions of applications for thousands of customers, generating billions in revenue. All without traditional hypervisors!

## Alternative Two: Serverless Computing

Now let me tell you about serverless - this is even more radical.

**How serverless works:**
You don't manage servers at all. You just upload your code, and the cloud provider runs it when needed. No VMs, no containers you need to manage - just functions that execute on demand.

**Real example: AWS Lambda**
AWS Lambda processes over 10 trillion requests per month. That's trillion with a T! And here's the interesting part - while Lambda does use some lightweight virtualization technology called Firecracker, these aren't traditional hypervisors. They're micro-VMs that are purpose-built for serverless, not full-fledged virtual machines.

**Why serverless is different:**
- No persistent VMs sitting idle
- You pay only per execution
- Infinite automatic scaling
- No server management at all

This proves you can have a massively successful cloud service without traditional virtualization!

## Alternative Three: Bare-Metal Cloud

Here's an interesting one - what if we just give customers dedicated physical servers?

**How it works:**
Companies like Equinix Metal (formerly Packet.io) provide actual physical servers on demand. You order a server, they provision it in minutes, you get complete control. No hypervisor, no sharing, no virtualization at all!

**When this makes sense:**
- High-performance computing where every bit of performance matters
- Databases that need maximum I/O performance
- Legacy applications that don't work well virtualized
- Compliance requirements that mandate physical isolation

**Success proof:**
Equinix acquired Packet.io for $335 million. That's a successful business model right there, and it's completely hypervisor-free!

## Alternative Four: WebAssembly on the Edge

Now this is the future - WebAssembly, or Wasm.

**The concept:**
You compile your code to WebAssembly, which runs in a lightweight runtime. No operating system, no hypervisor - just your code running in a sandbox. It's fast, it's secure, it's portable.

**Real implementation: Cloudflare Workers**
Cloudflare Workers runs billions of requests per day using WebAssembly. Cold start time? Less than 1 millisecond! Compare that to Lambda's 100+ milliseconds or a VM's minutes. They have thousands of paying customers and it's growing rapidly.

The isolation comes from the WebAssembly sandbox, not from virtualization. It's a completely different approach to security and multi-tenancy.

## What Would a Hypervisor-Free Cloud Look Like?

Let me paint you a picture of this future cloud platform:

**The architecture would have:**

First, bare-metal servers running a lightweight operating system. No hypervisor layer eating up resources.

Second, Kubernetes for orchestration - managing containers across all these servers. Kubernetes doesn't need hypervisors; it works perfectly well on bare metal.

Third, for isolation, we'd use a combination of:
- Hardware-based security like Intel SGX (secure enclaves)
- Container isolation through namespaces
- Network-level isolation through software-defined networking
- Lightweight micro-VMs like Firecracker when needed

Fourth, different execution models for different needs:
- Containers for long-running services
- WebAssembly for edge computing
- Bare-metal for high-performance workloads
- Micro-VMs for serverless functions

## Real Examples That Exist Today

Let me share some concrete examples:

**Cloudflare Workers:**
- Millions of deployments worldwide
- No traditional VMs
- Uses V8 isolates (same technology Chrome uses)
- Supports WebAssembly
- Ultra-low latency

**Fly.io:**
- Uses Firecracker micro-VMs
- Much lighter than traditional hypervisors
- Provides VM-like isolation with container-like speed
- Growing rapidly with thousands of customers

**Google Cloud Run:**
- Fully managed container platform
- No VM configuration needed
- Automatic scaling
- Likely uses gVisor (a container runtime) rather than full VMs

**Vercel and Netlify:**
- Edge functions deployed globally
- Serverless execution
- Built on Node.js/Deno runtimes
- No VMs involved
- Multi-billion dollar valuations

## The Advantages of Going Hypervisor-Free

Let me tell you why this matters:

**First: Higher efficiency**
Without a hypervisor layer, you eliminate that overhead. A physical server that runs 20 VMs might run 100 containers. That's 5x more density! For cloud providers, this means much better economics.

**Second: Lower costs**
No hypervisor licenses to pay for (some cost thousands per year). Less complex infrastructure means lower management costs. These savings get passed to customers.

**Third: Better performance**
Without hypervisor translation, you get closer to native hardware performance. For I/O-intensive workloads, this can mean 95% efficiency instead of 80%.

**Fourth: Faster innovation**
Containers and WebAssembly are newer technologies with active development. New features come out regularly. The ecosystem is evolving rapidly.

## The Challenges We Face

Now let me be honest about the challenges:

**Security and isolation:**
This is the big one. Hypervisors provide strong isolation - they've been tested for decades. Containers are newer and the isolation is weaker since they share a kernel.

The solutions include:
- Hardware-based security like Intel SGX
- Kernel-level security features
- Network micro-segmentation
- Secure container runtimes like gVisor

**Multi-tenancy concerns:**
How do you safely put different customers on the same hardware without a hypervisor?

The answer is layered security:
- Strong container namespacing
- Resource limits using cgroups
- Hardware isolation features
- Network isolation through VPCs

**Live migration:**
With VMs, you can move them between servers while running. Containers are different - but we solve this through:
- Fast restart instead of migration
- Stateless architecture design
- Separated storage from compute

## The Hybrid Reality

Here's the truth - most successful clouds will use BOTH approaches!

**The practical strategy:**
- Traditional VMs for legacy workloads (maybe 40% of workloads)
- Containers for modern microservices (maybe 50% of workloads)  
- Serverless for event-driven functions (maybe 5% of workloads)
- Bare-metal for special requirements (maybe 5% of workloads)

Different workloads have different needs. One size doesn't fit all. The smart approach is flexibility.

## My Final Verdict

So, is it possible to have a successful public cloud without hypervisors?

**My answer: Absolutely YES - and it's already happening!**

The evidence is overwhelming:
- Cloudflare Workers: billions of requests, no traditional VMs
- Google Cloud Run: massive scale with containers
- Heroku: 15+ years of success with containers
- Vercel/Netlify: multi-billion dollar valuations
- Fly.io: growing fast with micro-VMs, not traditional hypervisors

**What this cloud looks like:**
It's diverse! It uses container orchestration through Kubernetes, WebAssembly for edge computing, lightweight micro-VMs for serverless, and bare-metal for high performance. It achieves isolation through hardware features, kernel security, and network segmentation rather than hypervisors.

**The key insight:**
Virtualization doesn't mean hypervisors. Virtualization is about abstraction and isolation. Hypervisors are just ONE way to achieve that. Modern alternatives - containers, WebAssembly, secure enclaves - are proving they can do it too.

The cloud is evolving beyond traditional hypervisors. The future is diverse, flexible, and optimized for different workload types. That's exciting!

Thank you!
