# Zero Trust Architecture: How does Identity & Access Management (IAM) enforce it in the cloud?

## Introduction

"Never trust, always verify" - that's Zero Trust! Let's explore how IAM makes this possible in the cloud, where the traditional security perimeter no longer exists.

## Understanding Zero Trust

### The Old Way: Castle and Moat

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Security"
        A[Corporate Network] --> B[Firewall]
        B --> C{Inside Network?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Full Access ✅]
        C -->|No| E[No Access ❌]
    end
```

**Problem:** Once someone gets inside (hacker, malicious insider), they can access everything!

**Real Example:** Target breach (2013) - Hackers entered via HVAC vendor, accessed entire network, stole 40M credit cards.

### The New Way: Zero Trust

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Zero Trust Model"
        A[Every Request] --> B[Verify Identity]
        B --> C[Check Device Health]
        C --> D[Verify Location]
        D --> E[Check Permissions]
        E --> F[Allow Minimal Access]
        F --> G[Monitor Continuously]
    end
```

**Principle:** "Never trust, always verify" - even if you're already inside!

## Core Principles of Zero Trust

### 1. **Verify Explicitly**

Always authenticate and authorize based on:
- ✅ Who you are (identity)
- ✅ What device you're using
- ✅ Where you're connecting from
- ✅ What you're trying to access
- ✅ When you're accessing it

### 2. **Least Privilege Access**

Give users the **minimum** permissions they need, nothing more!

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer] -->|Needs| B[Read Code]
    A -->|Gets| B
    A -->|Doesn't Need| C[Delete Production DB]
    A -.->|Denied| C
```

### 3. **Assume Breach**

Act like attackers are already inside! Limit blast radius.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Compromised Account] --> B[Limited Access]
    B --> C[Can only access App Dev]
    B -.->|Blocked| D[Cannot access Prod DB]
    B -.->|Blocked| E[Cannot access Finance]
    B -.->|Blocked| F[Cannot access HR Data]
```

## What is IAM (Identity & Access Management)?

IAM is the **gatekeeper** of your cloud resources. It manages:
- **Who** can access what (authentication)
- **What** they can do (authorization)
- **When** and **how** they can do it (policies)

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[IAM] --> B[Users]
    A --> C[Groups]
    A --> D[Roles]
    A --> E[Policies]
    
    B --> F[Individual identities]
    C --> G[Collection of users]
    D --> H[Assumed by services]
    E --> I[Permissions definitions]
```

## How IAM Enforces Zero Trust

### 1. **Identity Verification (Authentication)**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Login Attempt] --> B{MFA Required}
    B -->|Password| C[First Factor]
    B -->|Phone Code| D[Second Factor]
    B -->|Biometric| E[Third Factor]
    C --> F{All Valid?}
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F -->|Yes| G[Access Granted]
    F -->|No| H[Access Denied]
```

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- Something you **know** (password)
- Something you **have** (phone, security key)
- Something you **are** (fingerprint, face)

**Real Example:** AWS requires MFA for root account access to production.

### 2. **Least Privilege via Policies**

IAM policies define **exactly** what actions are allowed:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**This policy says:**
- ✅ Can READ objects from my-bucket
- ✅ Only from specific IP range
- ❌ Cannot WRITE or DELETE
- ❌ Cannot access other buckets

### 3. **Conditional Access**

Access depends on context!

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Access Request] --> B{Check Conditions}
    B --> C{Correct IP?}
    B --> D{Right Time?}
    B --> E{Secure Device?}
    B --> F{MFA Enabled?}
    
    C -->|Yes| G{All Pass?}
    D -->|Yes| G
    E -->|Yes| G
    F -->|Yes| G
    
    G -->|Yes| H[Grant Access]
    G -->|No| I[Deny Access]
```

**Example Conditions:**
- ✅ Access only from office IP
- ✅ Access only during business hours
- ✅ Require MFA for sensitive operations
- ✅ Block from unknown countries

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Users don't have direct permissions - they assume **roles**!

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Developer] -->|Assumes| B[Dev Role]
    C[DevOps Engineer] -->|Assumes| D[DevOps Role]
    E[Manager] -->|Assumes| F[Manager Role]
    
    B --> G[Access: Dev Environment]
    D --> H[Access: All Environments]
    F --> I[Access: Reports Only]
```

**Benefits:**
- Change role permissions → affects all users with that role
- Users can switch roles based on task
- Temporary elevated access possible

### 5. **Service-to-Service Authentication**

Even services must authenticate!

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Web App] -->|Needs| B[Database Access]
    A -->|Assumes| C[App Role]
    C -->|Has Policy| D[DB Read/Write]
    D --> E[Access Granted]
```

**Example:** EC2 instance assumes role to access S3 (no hardcoded credentials!)

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring & Logging**

Every action is logged and monitored!

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User Action] --> B[CloudTrail Logs]
    B --> C[Who did what, when, from where]
    C --> D{Anomaly Detection}
    D -->|Suspicious| E[Alert Security Team]
    D -->|Normal| F[Continue]
    
    E --> G[Investigate]
    G --> H[Revoke Access if Needed]
```

**What's Logged:**
- Who accessed what resource
- What action they performed
- When it happened
- From where (IP, device)
- Whether it succeeded or failed

## Zero Trust IAM in Action

### Scenario: Developer Accesses Production Database

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer Request] --> B{Identity Check}
    B -->|Valid User?| C{MFA Verified?}
    C -->|Yes| D{Has Permission?}
    D -->|Yes| E{From Office IP?}
    E -->|Yes| F{During Business Hours?}
    F -->|Yes| G{Device Compliant?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Grant Read-Only Access]
    H --> I[Log Everything]
    I --> J[Monitor for Anomalies]
    
    B -->|No| K[Deny + Alert]
    C -->|No| K
    D -->|No| K
    E -->|No| K
    F -->|No| K
    G -->|No| K
```

**Security Layers:**
1. ✅ Identity verified
2. ✅ MFA confirmed
3. ✅ Least privilege (read-only)
4. ✅ Location verified
5. ✅ Time-based access
6. ✅ Device compliance
7. ✅ Full audit trail

## IAM Best Practices for Zero Trust

### 1. **Enable MFA Everywhere**

```
❌ Password only
✅ Password + MFA
✅✅ Password + MFA + Conditional Access
```

### 2. **Use Groups and Roles, Not Individual Permissions**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[❌ Bad] --> B[Assign policy to each user]
    C[✅ Good] --> D[Create groups/roles]
    D --> E[Assign users to groups]
    D --> F[Manage policies on groups]
```

### 3. **Implement Least Privilege**

Start with ZERO permissions, add only what's needed!

```
Developer needs S3 access:
❌ s3:* (all actions)
✅ s3:GetObject (read only)
✅✅ s3:GetObject on specific bucket
```

### 4. **Use Temporary Credentials**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request Access] --> B[Assume Role]
    B --> C[Get Temporary Creds]
    C --> D[Valid for 1 hour]
    D --> E[Automatic Expiry]
```

**Benefits:**
- Credentials expire automatically
- Stolen credentials have limited lifetime
- Can't be replayed later

### 5. **Separate Duties**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Production Access] --> B[Requires 2 Roles]
    B --> C[Developer Role]
    B --> D[Manager Approval Role]
    C --> E[Both Must Authenticate]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Access Granted]
```

### 6. **Regular Access Reviews**

```
Monthly:
- Review user permissions
- Remove unused access
- Check for overprivileged accounts
- Verify MFA compliance
```

## Real-World Example: AWS Zero Trust Setup

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Access"
        A[Employee] --> B[SSO with Okta/Azure AD]
        B --> C[MFA Required]
        C --> D[Assume AWS Role]
    end
    
    subgraph "IAM Policies"
        D --> E{Role Type}
        E -->|Developer| F[Dev Environment Only]
        E -->|DevOps| G[All Environments]
        E -->|Auditor| H[Read-Only Access]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        F --> I[CloudTrail Logs]
        G --> I
        H --> I
        I --> J[SIEM Analysis]
        J --> K{Anomaly?}
        K -->|Yes| L[Alert + Block]
    end
```

### Configuration:

**1. Identity Provider (IdP):**
- Use Azure AD or Okta
- Enforce MFA
- Integrate with AWS SSO

**2. IAM Roles:**
```
Role: Developer
- Access to dev environment
- Read-only in staging
- No production access
- MFA required
- Office IP only
```

**3. Service Control Policies (SCPs):**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:DeleteBucket",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-xxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

**This prevents:**
- ❌ Deleting S3 buckets from outside organization
- ❌ Even administrators can't bypass

## Common IAM Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

### ❌ 1. Using Root Account

```
Root Account = God Mode = Dangerous!

Create admin user instead
Enable MFA on root
Lock root credentials in vault
```

### ❌ 2. Hardcoded Credentials

```python
# ❌ NEVER DO THIS
aws_access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
aws_secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

# ✅ DO THIS
# Use IAM roles for EC2/Lambda
# Use environment variables
# Use AWS Secrets Manager
```

### ❌ 3. Overly Permissive Policies

```json
// ❌ BAD
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"
}

// ✅ GOOD
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
```

### ❌ 4. No Access Reviews

```
Employees leave → Accounts remain
Contractors finish → Still have access
Roles change → Old permissions remain

Solution: Automated access reviews + lifecycle management
```

## The Future: Intelligent IAM

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI-Powered IAM] --> B[Behavior Analysis]
    B --> C{Unusual Activity?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Adaptive MFA]
    C -->|Yes| E[Restrict Access]
    C -->|No| F[Normal Access]
    
    D --> G[Request Additional Verification]
```

**Emerging Technologies:**
- 🔮 Machine learning detects anomalies
- 🔮 Behavioral biometrics (typing pattern)
- 🔮 Risk-based authentication
- 🔮 Automated least privilege

## Conclusion

**Zero Trust + IAM = Cloud Security Foundation**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Zero Trust Principles] --> B[Verify Explicitly]
    A --> C[Least Privilege]
    A --> D[Assume Breach]
    
    E[IAM Enforcement] --> F[Authentication: MFA]
    E --> G[Authorization: Policies]
    E --> H[Monitoring: Logs]
    
    B --> E
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    E --> I[Secure Cloud Environment]
```

**Key Takeaways:**
1. ✅ Never trust by default - always verify
2. ✅ Use IAM to enforce least privilege
3. ✅ Enable MFA everywhere
4. ✅ Monitor and log everything
5. ✅ Regular access reviews
6. ✅ Use roles, not individual permissions
7. ✅ Assume credentials will be compromised
