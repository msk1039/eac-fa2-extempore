Course: Engineering a Cloud [BIT25PE03]
1. Cloud Deployment Models: Which is the most practical for a startup?
2. The Future is PaaS: Is this the ideal service model for application developers?
3. Public Cloud vs. Private Cloud: Which model provides better long-term Total Cost of
Ownership (TCO) for a company with predictable, high-volume traffic?
4. The Hybrid Cloud Dilemma: Is Hybrid Cloud an optimal, flexible solution or a
temporary, complex compromise between two environments?
5. IaaS vs. PaaS: When does the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) outweigh the
granular control offered by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)? Discuss this from a
developer's perspective.
6. The Race for Cloud Dominance: AWS vs. Azure vs. Google Cloud.
7. Virtual Machines vs. Containers vs. Serverless: The definitive choice for modern
applications.
8. The Importance of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in Global E-commerce (Focus on
Cloud networking components like VPC, Load Balancers, DNS, CDN)
9. Choosing the Right Storage Solution: Object, Block, or File?
10. Zero Trust Architecture: How does Identity & Access Management (IAM) enforce it in
the cloud?
11. Cloud Security is a Shared Responsibility: Who is truly accountable for a data breach?
12. GDPR and HIPAA: The impact of global compliance on cloud architecture.
13. Kubernetes: Why has it become the operating system of the cloud?
14. AI/ML in the Cloud: Democratizing intelligence for every business.
15. The Rise of Edge Computing: Is it a threat or a complement to the traditional cloud?
16. Bare-Metal vs. Hosted Hypervisors (Type 1 vs. Type 2): When does the extra overhead
of a Hosted Hypervisor become a benefit rather than a drawback?
17. Para-virtualization: An Ethical Compromise? Discuss the trade-offs of modifying the
Guest OS kernel for better performance.
18. Virtualization is the Foundation of Cloud Computing. Is it possible to have a successful
public cloud without hypervisors, and what would that look like?
19. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): The future of corporate IT or an expensive niche
solution?
20. The Containerization Challenge: Are Docker and Kubernetes making traditional Virtual
Machines obsolete for microservices, or do VMs still hold a critical security advantage?
21. Security Isolation: The Host OS vulnerability is a single point of failure for all containers.
Is the Hypervisor's isolation layer a fundamentally more secure approach?
22. The Cloud Workhorse: Why has the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), particularly
AES-256, become the universal default for data-at-rest encryption across major cloud
platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)? Discuss its security against brute-force attacks.
23. RDS vs. DynamoDB for E-commerce: Argue the case for which database is the optimal
choice for a highly-scalable, global e-commerce product catalog and checkout system.
24. Structured vs. Flexible Schema: When is the rigid nature of a SQL schema a necessary
security or integrity feature, and when does the flexibility of NoSQL become a
performance killer?
25. Cloud monitoring tool: its advantages for cloud provider and consumer
26. Why cloud monitoring is essential for maintaining cloud services
27. How CloudWatch helps in tracking performance metrics in AWS
