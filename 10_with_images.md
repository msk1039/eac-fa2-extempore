# Zero Trust Architecture: How does Identity & Access Management (IAM) enforce it in the cloud?

## Introduction

Good morning everyone! Today I want to talk about a fundamental shift in security thinking called Zero Trust. The old saying was "trust but verify." The new mantra is "never trust, always verify." Let me explain how IAM makes this possible in the cloud.

## Understanding Zero Trust

In the old days, security was like a castle with a moat. Once you got past the gate (the firewall), you could access everything inside. The problem? If a hacker got in - maybe through a stolen password or a phishing email - they had free rein over everything.

Zero Trust changes this completely. It says: Don't trust anyone or anything by default, even if they're already inside your network. Every single request, every single time, must be verified. It's like having security checkpoints everywhere, not just at the entrance.

*This diagram shows the Zero Trust flow: every request goes through identity verification, then authorization check, then context validation (device, location, time). Only if all checks pass does the system grant minimal necessary access, and monitoring continues throughout.*

## Understanding Zero Trust

### The Old Way: Castle and Moat

**Problem:** Once someone gets inside (hacker, malicious insider), they can access everything!

**Real Example:** Target breach (2013) - Hackers entered via HVAC vendor, accessed entire network, stole 40M credit cards.

*This diagram shows the Zero Trust flow: every request goes through identity verification, then authorization check, then context validation (device, location, time). Only if all checks pass does the system grant minimal necessary access, and monitoring continues throughout.*

## How IAM Enforces Zero Trust

Now let me explain how Identity and Access Management - IAM - actually makes Zero Trust work in practice.

### First: Multi-Factor Authentication

IAM enforces that you prove who you are using multiple factors. Password alone isn't enough - that's just something you know. You also need something you have, like your phone, or something you are, like your fingerprint.

This means even if a hacker steals your password, they can't get in without also having your phone. It's like needing both a key AND a fingerprint scan to open a vault.

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 3](diagram_images/diagram_3.png)

*This diagram shows the MFA process: users must provide multiple forms of authentication - password (what you know), phone code (what you have), and potentially biometric (what you are). Only when all factors are validated is access granted.*

### Second: Least Privilege Access

IAM implements the principle of least privilege - give people only the minimum permissions they absolutely need. A developer might need to read code and deploy to the development environment, but they definitely don't need the ability to delete the production database!

This is enforced through policies that explicitly define what actions are allowed on which resources. If it's not explicitly allowed, it's denied.

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 4](diagram_images/diagram_4.png)

*This diagram illustrates least privilege: developers get exactly what they need (read code access) but are denied dangerous permissions they don't need (like deleting production databases).*

### Third: Continuous Monitoring

Here's the crucial part - IAM doesn't just verify you once and forget about it. It logs every single action you take. Who accessed what, when, from where, and what they did with it. If something suspicious happens - like someone accessing data at 3 AM from a different country - alerts go off immediately.

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 5](diagram_images/diagram_5.png)

*This diagram shows damage limitation: even if an account is compromised, Zero Trust with IAM ensures the attacker can only access what that specific account is permitted to access - limiting the "blast radius" of the breach.*

## My Final Advice

Here's what you need to remember: Zero Trust isn't just a buzzword - it's a fundamental rethinking of security for the cloud era. And IAM is the tool that makes it real.

Enable multi-factor authentication everywhere. Give users only the permissions they absolutely need. Log and monitor everything. Treat every request as suspicious until proven otherwise.

The old perimeter-based security is dead. Zero Trust with IAM is the future, and frankly, the present. Implement it today to protect your cloud resources. Thank you!

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**This policy says:**
- ‚úÖ Can READ objects from my-bucket
- ‚úÖ Only from specific IP range
- ‚ùå Cannot WRITE or DELETE
- ‚ùå Cannot access other buckets

### 3. **Conditional Access**

Access depends on context!

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 6](diagram_images/diagram_6.png)

**Example Conditions:**
- ‚úÖ Access only from office IP
- ‚úÖ Access only during business hours
- ‚úÖ Require MFA for sensitive operations
- ‚úÖ Block from unknown countries

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

Users don't have direct permissions - they assume **roles**!

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 7](diagram_images/diagram_7.png)

**Benefits:**
- Change role permissions ‚Üí affects all users with that role
- Users can switch roles based on task
- Temporary elevated access possible

### 5. **Service-to-Service Authentication**

Even services must authenticate!

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 8](diagram_images/diagram_8.png)

**Example:** EC2 instance assumes role to access S3 (no hardcoded credentials!)

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring & Logging**

Every action is logged and monitored!

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 9](diagram_images/diagram_9.png)

**What's Logged:**
- Who accessed what resource
- What action they performed
- When it happened
- From where (IP, device)
- Whether it succeeded or failed

## Zero Trust IAM in Action

### Scenario: Developer Accesses Production Database

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 10](diagram_images/diagram_10.png)

**Security Layers:**
1. ‚úÖ Identity verified
2. ‚úÖ MFA confirmed
3. ‚úÖ Least privilege (read-only)
4. ‚úÖ Location verified
5. ‚úÖ Time-based access
6. ‚úÖ Device compliance
7. ‚úÖ Full audit trail

## IAM Best Practices for Zero Trust

### 1. **Enable MFA Everywhere**

```
‚ùå Password only
‚úÖ Password + MFA
‚úÖ‚úÖ Password + MFA + Conditional Access
```

### 2. **Use Groups and Roles, Not Individual Permissions**

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 11](diagram_images/diagram_11.png)

### 3. **Implement Least Privilege**

Start with ZERO permissions, add only what's needed!

```
Developer needs S3 access:
‚ùå s3:* (all actions)
‚úÖ s3:GetObject (read only)
‚úÖ‚úÖ s3:GetObject on specific bucket
```

### 4. **Use Temporary Credentials**

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 12](diagram_images/diagram_12.png)

**Benefits:**
- Credentials expire automatically
- Stolen credentials have limited lifetime
- Can't be replayed later

### 5. **Separate Duties**

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 13](diagram_images/diagram_13.png)

### 6. **Regular Access Reviews**

```
Monthly:
- Review user permissions
- Remove unused access
- Check for overprivileged accounts
- Verify MFA compliance
```

## Real-World Example: AWS Zero Trust Setup

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 14](diagram_images/diagram_14.png)

### Configuration:

**1. Identity Provider (IdP):**
- Use Azure AD or Okta
- Enforce MFA
- Integrate with AWS SSO

**2. IAM Roles:**
```
Role: Developer
- Access to dev environment
- Read-only in staging
- No production access
- MFA required
- Office IP only
```

**3. Service Control Policies (SCPs):**
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:DeleteBucket",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "aws:PrincipalOrgID": "o-xxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  }
}
```

**This prevents:**
- ‚ùå Deleting S3 buckets from outside organization
- ‚ùå Even administrators can't bypass

## Common IAM Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

### ‚ùå 1. Using Root Account

```
Root Account = God Mode = Dangerous!

Create admin user instead
Enable MFA on root
Lock root credentials in vault
```

### ‚ùå 2. Hardcoded Credentials

```python
# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
aws_access_key = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
aws_secret_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"

# ‚úÖ DO THIS
# Use IAM roles for EC2/Lambda
# Use environment variables
# Use AWS Secrets Manager
```

### ‚ùå 3. Overly Permissive Policies

```json
// ‚ùå BAD
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "*",
  "Resource": "*"
}

// ‚úÖ GOOD
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
}
```

### ‚ùå 4. No Access Reviews

```
Employees leave ‚Üí Accounts remain
Contractors finish ‚Üí Still have access
Roles change ‚Üí Old permissions remain

Solution: Automated access reviews + lifecycle management
```
