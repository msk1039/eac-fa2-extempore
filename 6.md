    A[Pricing Models] --> B[AWS: Complex but flexible]
    A --> C[Azure: Enterprise discounts]
    A --> D[GCP: Automatic discounts]
    B --> E[Reserved instances]
    C --> F[Hybrid benefits]
    D --> G[Sustained use ⭐]
```

**AWS:**
- Most complex pricing
- Reserved instances save up to 75%
- Spot instances for batch work

**Azure:**
- Enterprise Agreement discounts
- Hybrid benefit (huge savings for Windows!)
- Similar to AWS pricing

**Google Cloud:**
- 🏆 Simpler pricing
- Automatic sustained use discounts
- Committed use discounts
- Per-second billing

**Example:** Running a VM 24/7 on GCP automatically gets cheaper after first month (no setup needed!).

### 6. **Global Infrastructure**

**AWS:**
- 🏆 **WINNER** - 31 regions, 99 AZs
- Most countries covered
- Best CDN (CloudFront)

**Azure:**

## Who Should Choose What?

### Choose AWS If:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Choose AWS] --> B[Startup/Default Choice]
    A --> C[Widest Service Range Needed]
    A --> D[Largest Ecosystem Important]
    A --> E[Most Tutorials/Resources]
```

✅ You're a startup (most tutorials assume AWS)  
✅ You need the widest range of services  
✅ You want the largest talent pool  
✅ You're building general-purpose applications  
✅ Global presence is critical  

**Example Companies:** Netflix, Airbnb, NASA

### Choose Azure If:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Choose Azure] --> B[Microsoft Tech Stack]
    A --> C[Enterprise/Corporate]
    A --> D[Hybrid Cloud Needs]
    A --> E[.NET Applications]
```

✅ You use Microsoft products (Office 365, Active Directory)  
✅ You're an enterprise with Microsoft licensing  
✅ You need hybrid cloud (on-premise + cloud)  
✅ You're a .NET shop  
✅ You want one vendor for everything  

**Example Companies:** BMW, Adobe, Samsung

### Choose Google Cloud If:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Choose GCP] --> B[AI/ML Applications]
    A --> C[Data Analytics]
    A --> D[Kubernetes-Heavy]
    A --> E[Simpler Pricing Preferred]
```

✅ You're building AI/ML applications  
✅ You need advanced data analytics  
✅ You're heavily using Kubernetes  
✅ You want cutting-edge technology  
✅ You prefer simpler pricing

    A --> C[Secondary Cloud]
    A --> D[Specialized Services]
    B --> E[AWS or Azure]
    C --> E
    D --> F[GCP for AI]
    D --> G[AWS for Storage]
    D --> H[Azure for Enterprise Apps]
```

**Smart companies use:**
- Primary cloud for most services (80%)
- Other clouds for specific strengths (20%)

**Example:**
- Main infrastructure: AWS
- Machine learning: Google Cloud
- Enterprise apps: Azure

## My Prediction: Who Will Win?

**Short Term (2025-2027):**
- AWS maintains lead
- Azure grows in enterprise
- GCP grows in AI/data

**Long Term (2030+):**
- All three will coexist
- Specialization over domination
- Multi-cloud becomes normal
