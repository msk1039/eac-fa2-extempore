# Choosing the Right Storage Solution: Object, Block, or File?

## Introduction

Good morning everyone! Today I want to help you understand one of the most confusing aspects of cloud computing - choosing the right storage type. Should you use object storage, block storage, or file storage? Let me make this simple for you.

## Understanding the Three Storage Types

Think of these three storage types like different ways to organize your stuff.

**Object Storage** is like a massive warehouse where everything has a unique barcode. You don't organize things in folders - you just give each item a unique ID and find it using that ID. Perfect for storing millions of photos or videos.

**Block Storage** is like a traditional hard drive attached directly to your computer. It's raw, fast, and you can format it however you want. Perfect for databases that need lightning-fast access.

**File Storage** is like a shared network folder at your office. Multiple people can access the same files simultaneously, organized in familiar folders and subfolders. Perfect for team collaboration.

*This diagram shows the three storage types and their key characteristics: Object storage has a flat structure with HTTP access and unlimited scalability; Block storage provides raw blocks with low latency for single attachment; File storage offers hierarchical organization with shared access across multiple systems.*

## When to Use Each Type

Let me give you clear guidance on when each storage type makes sense.

**Use Object Storage for media and backups.** If you're storing millions of images, videos, or files that don't change often, object storage is perfect. It's incredibly cheap, infinitely scalable, and super reliable. Netflix stores all their movies and shows in object storage. You can too!

Examples: Product photos for an e-commerce site, user uploads in a mobile app, backup files, website static assets.

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 2](diagram_images/diagram_2.png)

*This diagram shows how object storage works: each item (image, video, document) is stored as an independent object with its own unique identifier and rich metadata like size, type, upload date, and custom tags.*

**Use Block Storage for databases.** When you need lightning-fast performance and the ability to modify data in place, block storage is the answer. It's like having a super-fast SSD attached directly to your server. Every database - MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB - should run on block storage.

Examples: Database servers, operating system boot drives, high-performance applications.

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 3](diagram_images/diagram_3.png)

*This diagram illustrates block storage: data is divided into fixed-size blocks (usually 4KB each). When a database reads or writes data, it directly accesses specific blocks, providing microsecond-level latency for high performance.*

**Use File Storage for shared access.** If multiple servers or people need to access the same files simultaneously, file storage is your solution. Think shared code repositories, content management systems like WordPress, or collaborative work environments.

Examples: WordPress sites with multiple web servers, shared development environments, team file collaboration.

## The Simple Decision Rule

Here's my simple rule: For ninety percent of your data - photos, videos, backups, archives - use object storage. It's cheap and scales forever.

For your databases and applications that need speed, use block storage. It's faster but more expensive.

Only use file storage when you specifically need multiple servers accessing the same files simultaneously.

Most applications actually use all three! Your e-commerce site might store product images in object storage, run the database on block storage, and use file storage for shared configuration files across web servers.

## My Final Advice

Don't overthink this. Start with object storage for most things - it's the Swiss Army knife of storage. Add block storage when you set up databases. Consider file storage only if you have a specific need for shared access.

The great thing about cloud storage is you can easily change your mind later. Start simple, optimize as you grow. Thank you!

**AWS EBS** (Elastic Block Store)  
**Azure Disk Storage**  
**Google Persistent Disks**  
**iSCSI, SAN storage**

### Perfect Use Cases:

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 4](diagram_images/diagram_4.png)

### Example: Database Server

```bash
# Attach EBS volume to EC2
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-123 --instance-id i-456

# Format volume
mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf

# Mount volume
mount /dev/xvdf /var/lib/mysql

# Database now uses block storage for data
```

### Performance Tiers:

| Type | IOPS | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| **HDD** | 500 | Backups, logs |
| **SSD** | 16,000 | General purpose |
| **Provisioned IOPS** | 64,000 | High-performance DBs |
| **NVMe** | 250,000+ | Ultra-low latency |

### Pros & Cons:

**Pros:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Low latency (microseconds)
- ðŸŸ¢ High IOPS for databases
- ðŸŸ¢ Can modify in place
- ðŸŸ¢ Supports any file system
- ðŸŸ¢ Snapshot capability

**Cons:**
- ðŸ”´ Limited scalability (max size limits)
- ðŸ”´ Single VM attachment (usually)
- ðŸ”´ More expensive than object storage
- ðŸ”´ Manual management
- ðŸ”´ Not accessible via HTTP

## File Storage: The Shared Network Drive

### What is it?

Think of **file storage** as a shared network folder that multiple people can access!

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 5](diagram_images/diagram_5.png)

### Characteristics:

- **Hierarchical structure:** Folders and subfolders
- **Shared access:** Multiple servers simultaneously
- **File locking:** Prevents conflicts
- **Protocols:** NFS (Linux), SMB/CIFS (Windows)
- **Permissions:** User/group access control

### Real-World Examples:

**AWS EFS** (Elastic File System)  
**Azure Files**  
**Google Filestore**  
**NetApp, NAS devices**

### Perfect Use Cases:

âœ… **Shared application data:** CMS, web apps  
âœ… **Home directories:** User files  
âœ… **Content management:** WordPress, Drupal  
âœ… **Development environments:** Shared code  
âœ… **Media workflows:** Video editing teams  
âœ… **Container storage:** Shared volumes for Kubernetes  

### How It Works:

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 6](diagram_images/diagram_6.png)

### Example: WordPress Site

```bash
# Multiple web servers share WordPress files
Server 1: mount -t nfs4 fs-123.efs.aws.com:/ /var/www/html
Server 2: mount -t nfs4 fs-123.efs.aws.com:/ /var/www/html
Server 3: mount -t nfs4 fs-123.efs.aws.com:/ /var/www/html

# All servers serve the same content
# Upload plugin on Server 1 â†’ visible on all servers
```

## Real-World Architecture Example

### E-commerce Platform:

![Generated Mermaid Diagram 8](diagram_images/diagram_8.png)

### Why Each Choice?

**Object Storage (S3):**
- Product images: Millions of files, serve via CDN
- Receipts: Archive, rarely accessed
- Backups: Long-term retention

**Block Storage (EBS):**
- MySQL: Needs low latency, high IOPS
- Redis: In-memory cache needs fast disk

**File Storage (EFS):**
- Config: Multiple web servers need same config
- Sessions: Share user sessions across servers

## Cost Comparison Example

**Storing 10 TB for 1 month:**

| Storage Type | AWS Service | Cost/Month |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Object | S3 Standard | $230 |
| Object | S3 Infrequent Access | $125 |
| Object | S3 Glacier | $40 |
| Block | EBS gp3 | $800 |
| Block | EBS io2 | $6,500 |
| File | EFS Standard | $3,000 |
| File | EFS Infrequent | $250 |

**Lesson:** Object storage is MUCH cheaper for large datasets!

## My Recommendations

### For Startups:

**Default Setup:**
1. **Object Storage (S3)** for:
   - Static assets, media, backups
   - 80% of your data

2. **Block Storage (EBS)** for:
   - Database volumes
   - Application servers

3. **Skip File Storage initially**
   - Add only if you need shared access

### For Specific Scenarios:

**Building a video streaming platform?**
â†’ Object Storage (S3 + CloudFront CDN)

**Running a high-traffic database?**
â†’ Block Storage (Provisioned IOPS SSD)

**WordPress site with multiple servers?**
â†’ File Storage (EFS) for wp-content

**Mobile app backend?**
â†’ Object Storage (S3) for user uploads

**Real-time analytics?**
â†’ Block Storage (NVMe) for speed

## Modern Hybrid Approach

Most applications use **all three**!
